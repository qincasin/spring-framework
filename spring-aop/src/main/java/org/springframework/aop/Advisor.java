 *
 * <p>Spring AOP is based around <b>around advice</b> delivered via method
 * <b>interception</b>, compliant with the AOP Alliance interception API.
 * The Advisor interface allows support for different types of advice,
 * such as <b>before</b> and <b>after</b> advice, which need not be
 * implemented using interception.
 * 基本接口包含 AOP <b>advice<b>（在连接点采取的操作）和确定建议适用性的过滤器（例如切入点）。
